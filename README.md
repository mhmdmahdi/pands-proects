    Four features measured from each of 3 samples. These features were length and width of sepals and petals.

    The data set is a multivariate data set and can be imported directly into Python using sklearn.
    The data set consists of 3 Classes with 50 samples per data set totaling 150 samples.
    *Goal of assignment is to predict what type of Iris a flower is based off of the available data points (or given features).*

    Analysis can be done using Numpy and Numpy Arrays or using a Pandas DataFrame.
    (Can also be done using Python lists but this is not as good)
    Python has built in tools which can alalyse all the data and return basic descriptive statistics.
    This should be done for each iris type, then when a value is inputted the code generated should search through the available code and try to best predict where this inputted value should lie.
